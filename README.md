Part #1 of lab 7 is a simple code that using a loop function creates a diagonal line of 20 separate stars with three varities of color, size, shape. 
Using angle of position from my 'star' function I altered the position of each new star to move diagonally, resulting in a 3 stars being looped into a fully
