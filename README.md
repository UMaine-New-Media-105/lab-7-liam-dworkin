Part #1 of lab 7 is a simple code that using a loop function creates a diagonal line of 20 separate stars with three varities of color, size, shape. 
Using angle of position from my 'star' function I altered the position of each new star to move diagonally, resulting in a 3 stars being looped into a fully
diagonal pattern

Part #2 of lab 7 creates a full grid with multiple stars both horizontally and vetically. I added a certain amount of gradience into the function using color 
key fill in "starBuilder" to create cells of gradience. I am going to try and add a nested loop to change the gradience to be a full gradient across the whole 
image's composition.
