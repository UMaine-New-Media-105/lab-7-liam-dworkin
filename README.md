Part #1 of lab 7 is a simple code that using a loop function creates a diagonal line of 20 separate stars with three varities of color, size, shape. 
Using angle of position from my 'star' function I altered the position of each new star to move diagonally, resulting in a 3 stars being looped into a fully
diagonal pattern

Part #2 of lab 7 creates a full grid with multiple stars both horizontally and vetically. I added a certain amount of gradience into the function using color 
key fill in "starBuilder" to create cells of gradience. I am going to try and add a nested loop to change the gradience to be a full gradient across the whole 
image's composition.

Part #3 I could not get to work. I am trying to add some form of 'mouseIsPressed' functionality with a conditional to apply two separate sets of loops using different functions containing separate colors for the rowys and columns of stars. Hopefully it makes sense. If you've got any advice I'd love to hear it.
